# 💫 About Me:
I'm a software engineer studying Computer Science & Math at Wesleyan and Computer Engineering at Columbia. I’ve built and shipped backend and full-stack features at The Hartford, worked on Android privacy research at Privacy-tech-lab, and led development of an educational Unity game and a campus-wide app with 800+ users. I enjoy working on projects that blend engineering, research, and real-world use.
